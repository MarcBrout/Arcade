{\ttfamily \#include $<$File\-Input\-Stream.\-hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is a specialization of Input\-Stream that reads from a file on disk.

It wraps a file in the common Input\-Stream interface and therefore allows to use generic classes or functions that accept such a stream, with a file on disk as the data source.

In addition to the virtual functions inherited from Input\-Stream, \hyperlink{class_file_input_stream}{File\-Input\-Stream} adds a function to specify the file to open.

S\-F\-M\-L resource classes can usually be loaded directly from a filename, so this class shouldn't be useful to you unless you create your own algorithms that operate on a Input\-Stream.

Usage example\-: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keywordtype}{void} process(InputStream& stream);

FileStream stream;
\textcolor{keywordflow}{if} (stream.open(\textcolor{stringliteral}{"some\_file.dat"}))
   process(stream);
\end{DoxyCode}
