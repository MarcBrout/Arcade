{\ttfamily \#include $<$Memory\-Input\-Stream.\-hpp$>$}



\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class is a specialization of Input\-Stream that reads from data in memory.

It wraps a memory chunk in the common Input\-Stream interface and therefore allows to use generic classes or functions that accept such a stream, with content already loaded in memory.

In addition to the virtual functions inherited from Input\-Stream, Memory\-Input\-Stream adds a function to specify the pointer and size of the data in memory.

S\-F\-M\-L resource classes can usually be loaded directly from memory, so this class shouldn't be useful to you unless you create your own algorithms that operate on a Input\-Stream.

Usage example\-: 
\begin{DoxyCode}
\textcolor{keywordtype}{void} process(InputStream& stream);

MemoryStream stream;
stream.open(thePtr, theSize);
process(stream);
\end{DoxyCode}
