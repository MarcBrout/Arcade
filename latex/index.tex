Welcome on the Bunny Library (Lib\-Lapin) home page.

This library is designed to be fast to deploy and use\-: using callbacks and easy usage graphical and sound elements, the Lib\-Lapin is efficient when you wish to create a prototype of a game or any graphic application.

C\-P\-U and G\-P\-U computation are supported thanks to two types (t\-\_\-bunny\-\_\-pixelarray and t\-\_\-bunny\-\_\-picture) and allow you to choose whatever you need.

The Lib\-Lapin is designed with holes that are supposed to be filled by users through programming exercises on the website called \char`\"{}\-La Caverne Aux Lapins Noirs\char`\"{} which is currently unavailable.

Today, the Lib\-Lapin is used by Hanged Bunny Studio to participate to game jam like Ludum Dare.
